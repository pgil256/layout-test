## Layout Test

This is a simple layout test for a responsive cross-platform application.

The application uses CSS variables for easier theming and responsive design. The styles are divided into:

General styling
Left-side styling
Right-side styling
Button styling
Media queries for tablet and mobile layouts
Refer to Layout.css for the complete styling.

All styling is done via basic CSS and responsive styles. External libraries or frameworks like react-native-web were not implemented in this application.
